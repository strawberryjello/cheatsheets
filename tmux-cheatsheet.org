* tmux shortcuts
There are plenty of comprehensive cheatsheets out there; this isn't one of them. This is just a reference for shortcuts I haven't used often enough to muscle-memorize. (Is that a word?)

I'll refer to Ctrl-b as =<tmux>= here. (In my own setup I've remapped Ctrl-b to the backtick (=`=).)

** Sessions

Using =<tmux>=:
#+begin_src
<tmux>-:new   New session
<tmux>-s      Switch session (displays list you can select from)
<tmux>-d      Detach current session
#+end_src

Using the =tmux= command:
#+begin_src
tmux switch -t session-name   Switch to session specified
#+end_src

** Windows

Using =<tmux>=:
#+begin_src
<tmux>-&      Kill current window
#+end_src
