** Gems
*** ruby-lint
https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ruby-lint

from the readme:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ruby-lint is a static code analysis tool for Ruby. It is inspired by tools such as jshint, flake8 and similar tools. ruby-lint primarily focuses on logic related errors such as the use of non existing variables instead of focusing on semantics (e.g. the amount of characters per line).
#+END_QUOTE

*** YARD
http://yardoc.org/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
YARD is a documentation generation tool for the Ruby programming language. It enables the user to generate consistent, usable documentation that can be exported to a number of formats very easily, and also supports extending for custom Ruby constructs such as custom class level definitions.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Inch

Github
- https://github.com/rrrene/inch

From the readme:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=inch= is a little bit like Code Climate, but for your inline code documentation (and not a webservice).

It is a command-line utility that suggests places in your codebase where documentation can be improved.

If there are no inline-docs yet, =inch= can tell you where to start.

*** bcrypt-ruby
https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby

bcrypt-ruby is a Ruby binding for the OpenBSD bcrypt() password hashing algorithm, allowing you to easily store a secure hash of your users' passwords.
#+END_QUOTE

*** wicked_pdf
https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Wicked PDF uses the shell utility [[http://wkhtmltopdf.org/][wkhtmltopdf]] to serve a PDF file to a user from HTML. In other words, rather than dealing with a PDF generation DSL of some sort, you simply write an HTML view as you would normally, then let Wicked PDF take care of the hard stuff.
