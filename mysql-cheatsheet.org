* MySQL 5.5 cheatsheet
** Outside a session
Default login (with password prompt):
=mysql -u user -p whichdb=

Restore dump:
=mysql -u user -p whichdb < dump.sql=

Create dump:
=mysqldump -u user -p whichdb [whichtable...] > dump.sql=

** After starting a session
Create DB:
=create database whichdb;=

List databases:
=show databases;=

List tables:
=show tables;=

Describe table columns:
=describe tablename;=

Show privileges:
=show grants [for user];=

** Recipes
*** Store data from a table into a file
Example from [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/17685029][this StackOverflow answer]] (for a Ruby question)
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM mytable
  INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\mytable.csv'
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
#+END_SRC

Caveat: the user which runs this must have permission to write in the target directory
