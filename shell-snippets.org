You can use this loop in bash:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for i in */; do zip -r "${i%/}.zip" "$i"; done
#+END_SRC

=i= is the name of the loop variable. =*/= means every subdirectory of the current directory, and will include a trailing slash in those names. Make sure you cd to the right place before executing this. "=$i=" simply names that directory, including trailing slash. The quotation marks ensure that whitespace in the directory name won't cause trouble. =${i%/}= is like =$i= but with the trailing slash removed, so you can use that to construct the name of the zip file.

If you want to see how this works, include an =echo= before the =zip= and you will see the commands printed instead of executed.
